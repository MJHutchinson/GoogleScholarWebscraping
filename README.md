# Google Scholar Webscraping

A simple utility ot scrape the citations of a given paper from google scholar.

I would NOT reccomend running this reccursivly, Googl will pick up on it and ban you for a period of time. It does technically violate the terms of service so maybe don't use it at all. I leave this up here as it may either be useful in the future, or of use to someone else for an analogous task.
